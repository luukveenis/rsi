# RSI - Realistic Shell Interpreter

Author: Luuk Veenis

This is the first assignment of CSC 360. It implements a realistic shell
interpreter that interacts with the operating system using system calls.

## Useage

To compile the project simply type:
- make

To run the RSI simply type:
- ./rsi

## Notes

Readline is currently not installed on the lab machines, so this code will
not compile on them. However, linux.csc.uvic.ca has readline installed, so
please run it there. The assignment description suggests using readline,
so I assume this is okay.
